## Tensorflow 2 CNN Cifar10 Classification
This demo deploys the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Tensorflow 2 to classify Cifar10 images.

- Tensorflow Data Pipeline
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Techniques that helps prevents overfitting (EarlyStopping, BatchNormalization, Dropout)
- Tensorboard
- Saving Model (.h5, tf, weights)

## Getting started
Open `TF2_Cifar10_CNN.ipynb` on a jupyter notebook environment, or Google colab. The notebook consists of further technical details.

## Future Improvements
- Explore the use of data augmentation in image classifcation
- Explore the model performance on Cifar100 dataset
